# greyscaleify-images

## Notes

 - Must have http-server running otherwise there will be "tainted image" errors and other exceptions
 - Keep images locally - will prevent similar errors
 - Resize images to desired size before drawing and greyscaling them - otherwise the context will draw them as the original image size
